# outline-this-page

I really like the functionality of [Outline](https://outline.com/), but lazyness made me feel like it would be better if I didn't had to open a new tab and copy & paste the URL of the page I want to read. That's why I made this simple 3 line chrome extension.

Maybe I'll "customize" it further and if possible publish to the store, but for now this is it.
