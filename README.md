# outline-this-page

I really like the functionality of [Outline](https://outline.com/), but lazyness made me feel like it would be better if I didn't had to open a new tab and copy & paste the URL of the page I want to read. That's why I made this simple chrome extension.

 Soon on the Chrome Web Store (I guess?).
